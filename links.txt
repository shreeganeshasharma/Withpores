Nuclear Pore Complex
Entire NPC in vertebrate - Diameter of 120 nm
Diameter of open channel for small partiles - 9nm, 5.2nm(Wikipedia)
The most prominent feature of an individual NPC is a large central channel, ~7 nm in width and 50 nm in length. (https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=110695&ver=0&trm=nuclear+pore&org=)
Diameter of regulated channel for RNA and stuff - 25nm
Central channel/transporter - 40 nm for largest particle diffusion
55-70nm (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/nuclear-pore)

Pore density
7 pores per micrometers squared - kidney cells

https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/nucleus/nuclearpores.html
Pore density varies greatly and tends to be greatest among cells that are highly activate and differentiated, such as liver cells. A typical mammalian cell features approximately 3,000 to 4,000 pores along its nuclear envelope. The oocytes of certain amphibians, however, have such large nuclei and such a density of pores that the nuclear envelope of one of the cells may contain more than ten million pores.
